# Week6_Proj_Song_Recommender
Cl√©mence and Thao Project on Machine Learning at Ironhack Paris.

In this project, our objective is to suggest a similar song to what the user initially input.

We used the followings in the project:
  - Library: Spotipy
  - Number of data points: approx. 20,000 tracks
  - Data for analysis: audio features of each track (tempo, loudness, speechiness, dancibility, etc)
  - Model: Kmeans (with Elbow and Silhouette methods to determine the clusters needed)
  - Presentation: Streamlit

Results:
  - We were able to churn out very similar songs to the inputs (of different audio features selected by our teacher)
  - The project was voted by our classmates & teacher to have the most accurate outcomes.
